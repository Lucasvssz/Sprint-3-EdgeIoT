# We Offer the Support and Care Our<br />Girls Deserve
<strong><p>In this project, we developed a system based on Arduino, which can also be adapted to the ESP32, capable of measuring the force of kicks and touches made by players on a soccer ball. The main idea is to provide accurate data on the intensity and technique applied in each action.</p></strong>


>> Where We Focus::
<p>We aim to offer a practical tool both for training and performance analysis, enabling players to track their progress, identify areas for improvement, and encourage sports practice in a more technical and scientific way.</p>

<h2> How It Worksü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è </h2>

- üîßWe use a force sensor to monitor and record the intensity of an impact, such as a kick or touch on the ball.

- The sensor is connected to the Arduino, which processes the information and converts it into a force value. A LED can be triggered to indicate that a pre-set minimum force has been reached, providing immediate visual feedback.

- All components are safely and neatly connected on a breadboard, using jumper wires to simplify assembly and testing of the project.

>> System Architecture Overview

<h3>The system has a simple and functional architecture</h3>
<p></p>

<h2>(Input)‚¨ÖÔ∏è</h2>

- The force applied to the ball is captured by the FSR sensor.

- The sensor converts mechanical pressure into electrical resistance variation.

<h2>Processing</h2>

- The Arduino reads the analog values from the FSR sensor.

- The microcontroller processes the data to calculate the intensity of the kick or touch.

<h2>(Output)‚û°Ô∏è</h2>

- Results can be visualized on a LED (visual force indication) or sent to the serial monitor on a computer for logging and analysis.

- The system allows tracking the players‚Äô progress over time.
